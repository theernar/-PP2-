#Python variables: In this file i will practise all type of variables;

x, y, z = "PP1", "PP2", "Discrete structures"
print(x) #Result is: PP1.
print(y) #Result is: PP2.
print(z) #Result is: Discrete structures.

q = "You"
w = "will"
e = "pass"
r = "exam"
t = "very"
u = "good"
print(q,w,e,r,t,u,) #Result is: You will pass exam very good.
print(q+w+e+r+t+u) #Result is: Youwillpassexamverygood
